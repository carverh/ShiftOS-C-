# ShiftOS

Welcome to the official C# rewrite of the original ShiftOS 0.0.9. It is led by Michael VanOverbeek and developed by the community.

ShiftOS C# is licensed under the GNU General Public License 3.0. Before making any changes, I cannot stress this enough - PLEASE read the license document found in the root of the project.

## Code Documentation

Most of the code you'll be using in ShiftOS is documented and Visual Studio will tell you what it all means.

## How to contribute

You can contribute by forking the source code to your own repo, and pulling it down to your computer using a Git client. We recommend GitHub for Desktop. You can also use Atlassian SourceTree, or any other Git clients. It's up to you.

You can commit changes to your fork, but to have them in the main project, create a pull request from your fork to the actual game. Then, I (Michael) will review it, and if it gets accepted, it will be merged.
